# Authentication-and-Authorization
This is a mini project about log in, sign up and role functionality. It is created to help me build my new projects faster and not waste time on creating them again.

Tips:
* To register a new admin first run the project and go to that url: ".../UserAuthentication/RegisterAdmin".
* When this message pops up on the screen: "{"statusCode":1,"statusMessage":"User has registered successfully"}" this means the new admin is successfully added and now can log in with the admin's username and passsword. 
* Comment the RegistrationAdmin() method.
